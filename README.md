# Graphpy

Library for creating and manipulating graphs

## +++ WARNING: Work in Progress +++

This is a barebones graph lib. It has all critical foundations, but is still far from finished and as of now, probably riddled with small bugs

# Structure

The library models graph objects with nodes and edges, supporting node flags and edge weights, fully decked with logging, warnings and error handling

Composed of a single **graph.py** file to be imported. It is defined by 6 main classes: Type, Node, Graph, Validator, Builder and Converter.

## Default types
This library does not follow duck typing, it is designed with strong typing in mind.

# Logs, warnings and error handling

## Logging

This lib has a standard **always on** logging feature with negligible impact on performance. 

**Log type**

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

It comes predefined as DEBUG, but may be changed to WARNING or ERROR in code at *line 48* in **graph.py**:

```python
37 # Sets up log
38 def start_log():
39     """
40     Sets up log when import is made
41     """
42     if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
43         os.mkdir(log_dir)
44     logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
45                         datefmt="%d-%m-%y %H:%M:%S",
46                         filename=f"{log_dir}{log_name}",
47                         # filename=f"{log_dir}testlog.log",
48                         filemode='w', level=logging.DEBUG)

**VERBOSE toggle**

There is an optional VERBOSE toggle where the graphs present state is registered in the log after each operation.

WARNING: VERBOSE parses the entire graph into an adjacency dictionary after each operation (O(n) in time and O(nÂ²) in space). Not suitable for performance sensitive applications

Example:
```python
import graph

graph.VERBOSE = True
```
Log output with VERBOSE:

**Log defaults**

By default, whenever it is imported, the lib will automatically create a log file in a logs/ folder located in the main file directory. If no folder is found, it will create the folder first. 

<details>

Presets may be changed in **graph.py** at:

```python
20 # Log configs
21 log_date = str(time.strftime("%d-%m-%y %H:%M:%S"))
22 log_dir = "logs/"
23 log_name = f"graphlog {log_date}.log"
24 print(f"Session log started at {log_dir}{log_name}")
   ...
37 # Sets up log
38 def start_log():

42     if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
43         os.mkdir(log_dir)
44     logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',

48                         filemode='w', level=logging.DEBUG)
```
</details>

## MERCILESS toggle

By default, all mistakes are "punished" by raising an error. Even when not critical or relevant. This behaviour can be changed by toggling MERCILESS off.

**WARNING:** By toggling MERCILESS off, all error handling is turned off, and as such, may present erratic and unexpected behaviour.

```python
import graph

graph.MERCILESS = False
```

## Duck typing and MERCILESS toggle
This lib is designed to work natively with predefined types, as a way of enforcing certain graph characteristics and ensuring proper behaviours, both from its internal methods and future external algorithms in future releases. It is also planned to be extended to C++ in the future, being designed with it in mind.

Although not recommended, duck typing can be used by toggling MERCILESS off. Despite so, it has not been tested and will turn off all error handling, and as such, may present erratic and unexpected behaviour.

Enforced types:

```python
idtype = int
datatype = Any
flagtype = Union[int, float, str]
nodetype = Node
weighttype = Union[int, float]
nodelisttype = Dict[cls.idtype, cls.nodetype]
edgelisttype = Dict[cls.idtype, cls.weighttype]

adjmatrixtype = Union[List[List[Union[cls.weighttype, None]]],
                                  npt.NDArray[npt.NDArray[Union[cls.weighttype, None]]]]

adjlisttype = Union[List[List[Tuple[cls.idtype, cls.weighttype]]],
                                npt.NDArray[npt.NDArray[Tuple[cls.idtype, cls.weighttype]]]]

adjdicttype = Dict[cls.idtype, Union[cls.edgelisttype, None]]
```

# How to use

1. Start by importing the library
   > Modules can be imported directly from graph

```python
import graph
```
2. Instantiate a graph object
   > Graph can be jumpstarted with a nodelist, a dictionary {id: Node}

```python
import graph

my_graph = graph.Graph()
```

   * Similarly, you can start with a constructor


```python
import graph
from graph import Builder

adjmat = [[0, 1, 2],
          [None, 4, 5],
          [6, None, 8]]

my_graph = Builder.adj_matrix(adjmat)
```
3. Now operate using its built in functions

```python
my_graph.add_node(edges={0: 1, 5: 0})
my_graph.add_node()
my_graph.add_edge(7, 3)
my_graph.remove_node(2)
```


## Example code:

```python
import graph as gr
from graph import Graph, Builder, Converter, Type
import numpy as np

graph = Graph()
# gr.VERBOSE = True
# gr.MERCILESS = False
# node = gf.Node()
graph.add_node()
# graph.add_edge(0, 0, 5)
graph.add_node()
graph.add_edge(0, 1, 5)
for a in range(0, 5):
    graph.add_node(data=a, flag='red')

# node1 = graph.add_node(edges={1: 0})
# graph.nodes[1] = 5
graph.add_node(edges={0: 1, 5: 0})
graph.add_node()

graph.add_edge(7, 3)
# print("original", Converter.to_adjdict(graph))
graph.remove_node(2)
print(Converter.to_adjlist(graph))

adjmat = [[0, 1, 2],
          [None, 4, 5],
          [6, None, 8]]

graph2 = Builder.adj_matrix(adjmat)
graph2.add_node(data=5)
adj_list = Converter.to_adjlist(graph2, get_nodes=True)[0]
adj_list[0].append((9, 3))

adj_dict = Converter.to_adjdict(graph2, get_nodes=True)[0]
print(adj_dict)
graph3 = Builder.adj_dict(adj_dict)

print(Type.is_adjlist(adj_list))
graph.add_edge(7, 8, 5, symmetric=True)
# gr.MERCILESS = False
# graph.remove_edge(5, 7)
graph.add_edge(8, 8)
graph2.remove_node(2)

for key, node in graph.nodes.items():
    print(key, node.data, node.edges)
print(graph.size, graph.last_id)
print("---")
# graph = Builder.refactor(graph)
graph.remove_edge(7, 8)  # , symmetric=True)

for key, node in graph.nodes.items():
    print(key, node.data, node.edges)

print(graph.size, graph.last_id)

```
